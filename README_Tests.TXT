To run tests you can use the following commands:

For a specific file:
php artisan test tests/Feature/createSubscriberTest.php

For the whole folder:
php artisan test tests/Feature

If above does not work you will have to locate the tests with this command:

example:
C:\Users\Yaz\Desktop\integrationEngineerAssignment\mailerlite-app\vendor\bin\phpunit
